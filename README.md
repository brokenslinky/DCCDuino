# DCCDuino
Arduino controller for the center differential of Subaru STIs.

# Simplified Version
Most visitors to this repository will primarily be interested in the Manual_DCCD_Controller folder. I don't maintain this folder, but host it as a simplified example for users who wish to write their own logic without any of the application-specific logic which I run on my own rallycross car.

# Brocks_ACDC
This version is what I run on my own car and is an "active" center differential controller in that it responds to changes in vehicle state. Much more feature-rich than the manual version (and does include its own manual mode), but will be harder to troubleshoot.
