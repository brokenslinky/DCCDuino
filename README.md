# DCCDuino
Arduino controller for the center differential of Subaru STIs.

# Brocks_ACDC or Manual_DCCD_Controller?
I don't maintain Manual_DCCD_Controller. I only host it as a simplified example for users who wish to write their own logic.
Brocks_ACDC is the one I use on my rallycross car and may contain some application-specific code.
